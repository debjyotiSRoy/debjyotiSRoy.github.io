Work experience
======
* September 2019 - Present: Ph.D
  * Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University
  * Introduced PLANT (Pretrained and Leveraged AtteNTion), a novel transfer learning strategy enhancing XMTC decoders through attention optimization. This innovation not only advanced XMTC model performance but also led to the development of a SOTA L2R model, emphasizing my innovative contributions to information retrieval and information science.
  * Advisor: Javed A. Aslam 

* August 2017 - August 2019: Research Assistant
  * University of Illinois Chicago
  * Online Learning:
    * Proposed a gradient descent-based online learning algorithm for utility-maximizing buyers, addressing previous limitations.
    * Implemented realistic pricing strategies, overcoming drawbacks in existing approaches.
  * Computational geometry:
    * Developed efficient algorithms for simplifying complex geometric objects, vital for various applications like data compression and shape recognition.
    * Applied these algorithms to optimize memory space and enhance object recognition, showcasing problem-solving skills and adaptability.

* Feb 2016 - Aug 2016: Tech Research Scientist
    * Xerox Research Center India, Bangalore.
    * Combinatorics and Data Mining:
        * Developed an innovative polynomial time construction for $(n,k)$-universal sets, significantly improving upon previous best sizes.
        * Analyzed and implemented a fast frequent pattern mining algorithm in Java.
        * Demonstrated proficiency in data mining techniques and practical application in handling large transaction databases.

* Aug 2012 - Aug 2014: Research Associate
    * Indo-German DST-DFG, IIT Delhi, New Delhi
    * Approximation Algorithms in Improvable Model:
        * Proposed a randomized $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for budget constrained minimum spanning tree (BMST), improving upon previous solutions.
        * Enhanced the $2$-approximation of BMST to achieve a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation using randomization, dynamic programming, and scaling techniques.
        * Developed a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for weight-improvable shortest path in DAGs, running efficiently in $O(n^4/\epsilon)$ time.


* Jun 2011 - Aug 2011: Tech Reearch Scientist
    * Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai.
    * PRAM Algorithms for Multi-core Architecture:
        * Designed a framework to map PRAM algorithms onto parallel multi-core architectures, optimizing parallel time complexity through parametric equations based on the number of processors.
        * Implemented scheduling of operations into parallel phases and optimized processor allocation, resulting in a significant 39% improvement in parallelism.
